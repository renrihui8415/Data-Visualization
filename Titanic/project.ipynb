    "## Project Overview: Titanic Data Dashboard – A Fully Automated Web App\n",
    "\n",
    "The Titanic Data Dashboard is a **fully automated web application** designed to provide an in-depth, interactive analysis of the Titanic dataset. This project integrates data automation with advanced visualizations to create a seamless and engaging user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/dashboard.gif\" alt=\"Flow Chart\" style=\"width:1200px; height:auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python** (Flask): For developing the web application framework and handling backend processes.\n",
    "- **Data Visualization** (Plotly): For creating interactive and animated visualizations.\n",
    "- **Data Processing** (Pandas, NumPy): For managing, cleaning, and transforming data before visualization.\n",
    "- **SQLite**: For storing and managing the Titanic dataset.\n",
    "- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For building and styling the front-end interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automated Data Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this project comes from predefined sources, specifically the [Kaggle Titanic Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). The web app stores the Titanic dataset in an SQLite database.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single codebase manages the entire process—from data processing to the generation of dynamic visualizations—eliminating the need for any manual intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/flow_chart.png\" alt=\"Flow Chart\" style=\"width:600px; height:auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interactive Visualizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key Facts: A section that provides a quick summary of crucial statistics like the number of passengers, crew members, survivors, and the overall survival rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/key_facts.gif\" alt=\"Flow Chart\" style=\"width:300px; height:auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- Passenger Distribution by Class, Deck, and Cabin: An interactive **pie** chart offering insights into the demographic distribution of passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/pie.gif\" alt=\"Flow Chart\" style=\"width:300px; height:auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Survivor Flow Analysis: A **Sankey** diagram that traces the path of survivors based on gender, age, port of embarkation, and ticket class.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/sankey.gif\" alt=\"Flow Chart\" style=\"width:300px; height:auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- Geographical Mapping: An interactive **map** that visualizes the locations associated with the Titanic’s journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/map.gif\" alt=\"Flow Chart\" style=\"width:300px; height:auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ticket Price Analysis: A **jitter** plot that visualizes the distribution of ticket prices across different age groups, providing insights into how ticket prices varied among passengers of different ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/jitter.gif\" alt=\"Flow Chart\" style=\"width:300px; height:auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature Correlation Network: A **network** graph illustrating the relationships between various features, such as age, fare, and survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/network.gif\" alt=\"Flow Chart\" style=\"width:300px; height:auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- Survival Heatmap: A **heatmap** showing survival rates across different age groups and genders.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/heatmap.gif\" alt=\"Flow Chart\" style=\"width:300px; height:auto;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-Time Updates:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dashboard leverages SQLite3 for data management, allowing for **real-time data processing** and visualization. This capability makes the dashboard adaptable to various datasets, ensuring users can analyze and visualize data dynamically, beyond just the Titanic dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technology Stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "The web app is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with interactive visualizations powered by `plotly` and other Python libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The backend handles automated data processing using Python, ensuring that data is processed and visualizations are generated in a streamlined manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Seamless User Experience:\n",
    "\n",
    "All visualizations are embedded within the web app using **iframes**, providing a cohesive and fluid user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The app is designed for easy deployment on any standard web **server**, with the flexibility to incorporate additional data sources or expand the range of visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Titanic Data Dashboard** showcases how automated processes combined with interactive web technologies can transform raw data into compelling visual narratives, all within a single, user-friendly application.\n",
    "\n",
